## A Brief Overview of Mali

Mali is one of the world's poorest countries today, but was once one of Africa's mightiest empires. The nomadic desert lifestyle of Northern tribes has remained relatively unchanged for centuries. The diverse cultures of the country peacefully interact with each other. Each of Mali's own ethnic groups have their own languages.
