## A Brief Overview of Cote d'Ivoire

Cote d'Ivoire, sitting on the Ivory Coast, has a colorful culture with over 60 different indigenous tribes, all with their own distinct identities and traditions. Cote d'Ivoire has enjoyed economic prosperity since its liberation from France in the 1960s, but threats to the nations stability have emerged.

A military coup began in December 1999 which overthrew the government, while an armed rebellion in 2002 split the country in half. After peace accords and more civil wars, the country had its first peaceful vote in 2010 though unrest is still widespread.

The mask is the most iconic form of art in the country as the intricacy of designs convey cultural systems. There are many different religions prevelant in the country.
