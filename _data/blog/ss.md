## A Brief Overview of South Sudan

Western style clothing is common especially in cities, but traditional dress still varies throughout the country and ethnic groups. Oral tradition is used for folklore and myths, keeping traditions alive. Food production is the single activity that absorbs the energy of the country's people. Milk, lamb, chicken, rice, and vegetables are key ingredients in foods. Civil war has destroyed much of the economy in the South.
