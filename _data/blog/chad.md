## An Overview of Chad

Ruled by the colonial French in their early days has had a large impact on Chad society. Despite this, 200 ethnic groups still live in the country that live autonomously. Each ethnic group has its own literary tradition while most written materials in the cities are French. Dress is informal, but conservative to show respect for Muslim laws and ideals. The economy of Chad is still growing and the large oil deposits in the South of the country are helping it.
