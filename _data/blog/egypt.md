## A Brief Overview of Egypt
Egypt is one of the earliest civilizations and is a melting pot of sorts. Tourism is one of the main sources of income in the country and Egyptians are known for their good hospitality.

Family is very important to Egyptians and children often live with their parents until they get married. It is customary to wear only black for at least 40 days after a family member passes. Egyptians also enjoy celebrations with their families and extended families.

Muslim and Christianity are the main religions and both are intertwined with daily life. Mosques are on almost every street of every Egyptian city. The country follows the Western calendar but follows the Islamic calendar for Islamic religious holidays.
