## A Brief Overview of Gabon

While being strongly influenced by their former French colonists, there are a number of strong cultural pillars in Gabon. Dance, songs, myths, and poetry are important elements of Gabonese life, while common art forms include the creation of masks, sculptures, and musical instruments.

Traditional instruments in Gabon include the balafon, harp, mouth bow, drums, and bells. Culture in the country is expressed through paintings, sculptures, and fashion. Original dresses made by Gabon designers are well recognized in the world of African fashion. Up to 40 indigenous languages are spoken in Gabon, but French is the official language that is used and taught in all schools.

In 1839, the French established the first long-term European settlement in the territory. Gabon remained a French territory until it declared independence in 1960.
