## A Brief Overview of Liberia

Liberia was founded by freed slaves from the American South, who brought their own culture and displaced the ancient tribes who farmed the lands. After a devastating 14-year civil war the diverse ethnicities of the country are now at peace. The two main cultures in the country are those stemming from the American South and from the traditional African tribes who lived on the land.
