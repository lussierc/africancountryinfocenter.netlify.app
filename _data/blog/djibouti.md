## A Brief Overview of Djibouti
The country is a crossroad of trade and commerce, while being heavily influenced by it's ethnic clusters. The two dominant groups are the Afar and the Issa-Somali. The Issa Somali make up 60% of the population and are largely Muslim. Ethnic traditions still live in the country.

They were colonized by the French in 1862, till the two groups began to rebel against the French then they left in 1977 giving the country independence. The country has entered an era of peace since 2000.

There are many different traditions in the country, both modern and traditional. The official languages of the country are Arabic and French, though the multi-ethnic populations speak Somali and Afar. Religion, notably Islam, is still a main element of Djibouti culture. Music is an important part of everyday life, while folklore is still prevalent, and the locals dress to match the hot climate they reside in.
