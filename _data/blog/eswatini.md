## A Brief Overview of Eswatini
The country has two main cultural events. The first is Incwala which is a complex ritual of renewing the kingship and the nation, with special dances and songs for the occasion, lasting 6 days. The other is the Umhlanga, which brings the unmarried girls and young women of the country together to cut reeds to repair the windbreaks of the queen's home village for 5 days.

Common musical instruments are simple design, such as a kudu horn, a calabash, the reed flute, and more. Nowadays people listen to the radio or record/tape players.
