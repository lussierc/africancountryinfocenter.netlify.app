## A Brief Overview of Lesotho

Traditional authority in the country is still exercised through a system of chieftaincy, which extends from the king through the chiefs at the village level. Despite increasing urbanization and the growth of modern institutions, many Sotho are still interested in building a rural homestead and remaining loyal to the chieftaincy system.

Urban life is a blend of traditional and Western culture. Many buildings in the country were burned during looting following the election in 1998, but there are many modern and Western hotels, nightclubs, and more. Village life on the other hand, is dominated by basic agricultural tasks. Lesotho observes most Christian holidays.
